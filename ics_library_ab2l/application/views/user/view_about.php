												<h3 class="color-black">About the Library</h3>
												<div class="cell justify">
												<p>The ICS library started in 1996, a year after the foundation of the institute. From having only a few resources, the amount of information and innovative ideas began to cultivate year after year in the library with the increasing amount of reading materials like books, journals, theses, etc. The library was able to provide a warm environment where the faculty and students interact as both tries to deepen their understanding in Computer Science. And now, it strives to reach out anyone interested in the the course both in UPLB and beyond and have them experience that environment.</p>

												<div class="cell justify">
												<p>The current library administrative support is Marites M. Gironella. As the librarian for about 3 years and counting, she really enjoys it when she can interact with the users of the library and help them in their searches for the needed books to support in their academic life. She wants the library to be able to cater more people who wants to learn and provide the reading materials they need.	</p>

The developers of this system came from the class of CMSC 128 AB-2L under their instructors Reginald Recario and Kim Samaniego. Despite the diversity, everyone wanted to create a simple integrated library system that prioritizes the needs of its user.
